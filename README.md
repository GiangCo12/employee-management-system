# Employee-Management-System
In this project, I will build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) combining two powerful architectures, Inception and ResNet, Yolo, and use many libraries such as Facenet Pytorch in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions, bowing gestures, and correct uniform clothing. The data consists of 48x48 pixel scale images. The goal is to classify each face to identify which employees are pre-defined in the data. I will use OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. After you have trained, saved, and exported the CNN, I will directly serve the predictions of the trained model to the web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.
